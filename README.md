A fully integrated, admin-friendly WooCommerce shipping method that lets you configure all weight-based rules directly inside wp-admin.
Supports per-zone pricing, subtotal and quantity conditions, handling fee, free-shipping threshold, rounding modes, and optional filters by state and postcode — all editable through a smart table UI (no JSON editing).

Features:

Uses WooCommerce’s built-in Shipping Zones — define your own zones by states/postcodes.

Add unlimited rules per zone (weight ranges, base + per-kg + percentage cost).

Per-rule filters for product shipping class, states, and postcode patterns (regex supported).

Configure everything visually in the wp-admin settings table.

Auto-converts product weight units to kilograms.

Handles free shipping thresholds and handling fees automatically.

100% self-contained — no external APIs or dependencies.

Ideal For:
E-commerce stores needing flexible regional or weight-based shipping cost control (like Shiprocket-style logic) without third-party plugins.
